## GameBackdrop & GameBackdropGiana
1920x1200 - A celebration of a few classic games from the past.

The first version (GameBackdrop) was built around Super Mario Level 1, but I had to shrink it to fit the screen so it didn't look great. I was then asked to do a version without the Nintendo references so I did GameBackdropGiana. Since the Giana Sisters level 1 map is shorter it almost fit completely in 1920 pixels, so I could do this one pixel perfect.

I have mainly continued to work on the Giana Sisters based backdrop and focus on Amiga and C64 games even though a few other classics have gotten in - and yes, there still is a Ninitendo referrence :-o ..

Includes Gimp project file.

The level itself is Giana Sisters level 1 (C64). Interleaved in a few places are pipes from Pipe Mania (Amiga). Then, going from left to right, we see:

* Moonstone (Amiga)
