## GameBackdrop & GameBackdropGiana
1920x1200 - A celebration of a few classic games from the past.

The first version (GameBackdrop) was built around Super Mario Level 1, but I had to shrink it to fit the screen so it didn't look great. I was then asked to do a version without the Nintendo references so I did GameBackdropGiana. Since the Giana Sisters level 1 map is shorter it almost fit completely in 1920 pixels, so I could do this one pixel perfect.

Includes Gimp project file.
